      <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm a BCA graduate and aspiring professional actively seeking opportunities to grow and contribute in the design space. With a strong foundation in programming, HTML, and Java, I also bring creative skills in UI/UX design that focus on delivering user-friendly digital experiences. My background includes completing the RDC in NCC, which has helped me develop strong leadership, discipline, and time management skills. I take pride in being punctual, responsible, and a team player who thrives in both collaborative and independent environments. While I’m still exploring the right path for my long-term career, I’m passionate about learning, taking on challenges, and making a meaningful impact wherever I go.

        <h3>Rythm Space</h3>
        <p>Rythm Space Player is an innovative audio website designed to enhance the listening experience by allowing users to seamlessly separate and manipulate different audio tracks. Its user-friendly interface and advanced features empower users to enjoy personalized music playback like never before.
Plays two different audio tracks on separate output channels: Left and Right.
Designed for shared environments using a single device with multiple outputs (e.g., earbuds or speakers).RYTHM SPACE is a web-based split-channel music player designed to
provide an innovative and interactive audio experience directly through
the browser. The project addresses a practical limitation in conventional
audio playback systems, where both left and right audio channels
typically play a unified track. In scenarios where two users share the
same pair of headphones or where individualized audio processing is
desired, traditional players fall short. RYTHM SPACE fills this gap by
allowing users to upload two completely different audio files—one
mapped to the left channel and the other to the right. Each track can be
controlled independently, with separate playback, volume adjustment, and real-time visualization, offering a personalized and experimental
form of audio engagement. The motivation behind RYTHM SPACE lies in the growing demand for
accessible, lightweight tools that offer real-time interactivity without
relying on backend servers or external installations. With the widespread
availability of modern web browsers supporting advanced APIs like the
Web Audio API, it becomes possible to build rich multimedia
applications using only front-end technologies. RYTHM SPACE was
conceptualized not just as a technical demonstration but as a practical
solution for shared headphone usage, creative audio mixing, and
educational exploration. Users can experiment with spatial sound
perception, compare musical elements, or simply enjoy two different
tracks at once with minimal setup. Technically, the application is implemented using HTML5 for semantic
structure, CSS3 for responsive and themed styling, and JavaScript (ES6+)
for logic and dynamic interactivity. A key aspect of the project is the use
of the Web Audio API, which enables complex audio routing and
manipulation in the browser. Each uploaded audio file is connected to its
own AudioContext, then routed through a StereoPannerNode to isolate it
in the left or right channel. AnalyserNodes are also used to capture
frequency data, which is then used to animate real-time audio
visualizations. The player features volume sliders for each channel, drag- and-drop file support, and a toggle for switching between light and dark
themes to improve usability and comfort.
